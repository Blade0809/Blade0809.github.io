Hi, I’m Liu Liu(刘浏). I’m a first year master student at Shanghaitech [VDI center](https://vdi.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/) advised by Professor [Ye Shi](https://shiye21.github.io/).

Before that, I received my B.S. from Chongqing University advised by Professor Haibo Hu.

My research interests include **optimization** and **deep generative models**. Recently I am focusing on guidance on Diffusion Bridge.
